# ICCAD2016_ExtendCase
To evaluate the scalability of the proposed method, we extend Case1-Case4 in ICCAD 2016 Contest (ProblemC pattern classification) by generating new markers abutting each marker in four directions, i.e., left, right, up and bottom directions. 
The number of markers for each extended cases are almost 5 times than their original cases. 
The extended cases generated are in GDSII format. The files are:
Extend_case1.gds.zip
Extend_case2.gds.zip
Extend_case3.gds.zip
Extend_case4.gds.zip
